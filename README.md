Here's an example of Equinox code showcasing its dual syntax and interoperability features:

```equinox

// Equinox code with dynamic syntax (similar to Python)

// Importing a function from an existing Python library
import math.sqrt from python.math

// Defining a function using dynamic typing
def calculate_hypotenuse(a, b):
    return sqrt(a  2 + b  2)

// Calling the function with dynamic arguments
var result = calculate_hypotenuse(3, 4)
print("Hypotenuse:", result)


// Equinox code with explicit syntax (similar to TypeScript)

// Defining a function with static typing
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    return length * width

// Calling the function with static arguments
var area: float = calculate_area(5.5, 2.5)
print("Area:", area)
```

In this example, Equinox demonstrates its dual syntax capabilities. The first part of the code uses a dynamic syntax similar to Python, where the sqrt function from the Python math library is imported and used within the Equinox code. The calculate_hypotenuse function calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the imported Python function.

The second part of the code showcases the explicit syntax of Equinox, which resembles TypeScript. The calculate_area function calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width. The function's parameters are explicitly typed, and the return type is specified as float. The function is then called with static arguments, and the result is printed.

Here's an example of a simple photo gallery application using Equinox:

```equinox
import tkinter as tk  // Importing the tkinter module for GUI

// Define a list of photo paths
var photo_paths = [
    "path/to/photo1.jpg",
    "path/to/photo2.jpg",
    "path/to/photo3.jpg",
    // Add more photo paths as needed
]

// Create a tkinter window
var window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Equinox Photo Gallery")

// Function to display the next photo
def next_photo():
    // Get the next photo path
    var current_index = photo_paths.index(photo_label.cget("text"))
    var next_index = (current_index + 1) % len(photo_paths)
    var next_photo_path = photo_paths[next_index]
    
    // Update the photo label with the next photo path
    photo_label.config(text=next_photo_path)
    
    // Update the photo image
    photo_image = tk.PhotoImage(file=next_photo_path)
    photo_display.config(image=photo_image)
    photo_display.image = photo_image  // Store a reference to prevent garbage collection

// Create a label to display the current photo path
var photo_label = tk.Label(window, text=photo_paths[0])
photo_label.pack()

// Create an image display area
var photo_image = tk.PhotoImage(file=photo_paths[0])
var photo_display = tk.Label(window, image=photo_image)
photo_display.pack()

// Create a button to switch to the next photo
var next_button = tk.Button(window, text="Next", command=next_photo)
next_button.pack()

// Start the GUI event loop
window.mainloop()
```
In this example, the Equinox photo gallery application uses the tkinter module, which is a popular library for creating GUI applications in Python. The photo paths are stored in the photo_paths list, and the application starts by displaying the first photo in the list.

The next_photo() function is called when the "Next" button is clicked. It retrieves the index of the current photo path, calculates the index of the next photo path using modulo arithmetic, and updates the photo_label with the next photo path. It also updates the photo_display with the new photo image by creating a tk.PhotoImage object with the next photo path and configuring the photo_display label with the new image.

By offering both dynamic and explicit syntax, Equinox allows developers to choose the most suitable style based on their preferences, codebase requirements, or performance considerations.

The Equinox source code that demonstrates its dual syntax and interoperability features is as follows:

```equinox

// Equinox code with dynamic syntax (similar to Python)

// Importing functions from existing Python libraries
import "math" as python.math
import "random" as python.random

// Defining a function using dynamic typing
func calculate_hypotenuse(a, b) {
    return python.math.sqrt(a * a + b * b);
}

// Calling the function with dynamic arguments
var result = calculate_hypotenuse(3, 4);
print("Hypotenuse:", result);


// Equinox code with explicit syntax (similar to TypeScript)

// Defining a function with static typing
func calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float {
    return length * width;
}

// Calling the function with static arguments
var area: float = calculate_area(5.5, 2.5);
print("Area:", area);


// Equinox code with interoperability (JavaScript compatibility)

// Importing functions from existing JavaScript libraries
import "lodash" as js.lodash

// Defining a function using dynamic typing and JavaScript interoperability
func get_random_element(list) {
    return js.lodash.sample(list);
}

// Calling the function with dynamic arguments and JavaScript interoperability
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
var random_fruit = get_random_element(fruits);
print("Random fruit:", random_fruit);
```

As you can see, the source code offers more functionality to demonstrate the dual syntax and interoperability features of Equinox.

The first part of the code uses dynamic syntax similar to Python. It imports the sqrt and random functions from the Python math and random libraries, respectively. The calculate_hypotenuse function calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the imported Python sqrt function. It also demonstrates dynamic typing.

The second part of the code showcases explicit syntax similar to TypeScript. It defines the calculate_area function with static typing, specifying the length and width parameters as float types and the return type as float. The function calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width.

The third part of the code demonstrates interoperability with JavaScript. It imports the lodash library from JavaScript and defines the get_random_element function using dynamic typing. The function utilizes the lodash.sample function from JavaScript to retrieve a random element from a list. It showcases how Equinox can interoperate with existing JavaScript code and libraries.

This code provides a more detailed representation of Equinox's features and compatibility with existing programming languages.

Additionally, here are some additional examples that showcase the power and flexibility of Equinox, demonstrating how it simplifies complex programming tasks, improves productivity, and enables developers to achieve specific goals more effectively:

// Create an instance of the Express.js server
var app = js.express()

// Define a route that handles GET requests to the root URL
app.get('/', func(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello, Equinox!")
})

// Start the server and listen on port 3000
app.listen(3000, func() {
    print("Server started on port 3000")
})
```

In this example, Equinox leverages the popular Express.js library from JavaScript to create a web server. The Equinox code integrates seamlessly with the JavaScript library, allowing developers to benefit from the extensive ecosystem and powerful features of Express.js while writing code in Equinox. This combination simplifies web development tasks and enables developers to build scalable and feature-rich web applications.

import "pandas" as python.pandas
import "sklearn" as python.sklearn

// Load a dataset using the Python pandas library
var dataset = python.pandas.read_csv("data.csv")

// Perform data preprocessing using Equinox
dataset = dataset.dropna()
dataset = dataset.drop_duplicates()

// Split the dataset into features and labels
var X = dataset.drop("target", axis=1)
var y = dataset["target"]

// Train a machine learning model using the Python scikit-learn library
var model = python.sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

// Make predictions using the trained model
var predictions = model.predict(X)

// Evaluate the model's performance
var accuracy = python.sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

In this example, Equinox seamlessly integrates with popular Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn. It demonstrates how Equinox can be used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. By combining the data manipulation capabilities of pandas with the machine learning algorithms of scikit-learn, Equinox enables efficient and streamlined data science workflows.

Equinox can be used to develop games, leveraging existing game engines and libraries. Here's an example of using Equinox with the Unity game engine:

```equinox
import "UnityEngine" as unity

// Create a new GameObject
var gameObject = unity.GameObject()

// Add a component to the GameObject
gameObject.AddComponent(unity.Rigidbody)

// Access and modify component properties
var rigidbody = gameObject.GetComponent(unity.Rigidbody)
rigidbody.mass = 1.5
rigidbody.velocity = unity.Vector3(0, 0, 10)

// Instantiate a prefab
var prefab = unity.Resources.Load("EnemyPrefab")
var enemy = unity.Object.Instantiate(prefab)

// Access and modify GameObject properties
enemy.transform.position = unity.Vector3(5, 0, 0)
enemy.transform.rotation = unity.Quaternion.Euler(0, 90, 0)
```

In this example, Equinox integrates with the Unity game engine using the Unity API provided by the UnityEngine module. It demonstrates how Equinox can be used to create and manipulate game objects, add components, modify properties, and instantiate prefabs. By leveraging the capabilities of existing game engines and libraries, Equinox empowers developers to create immersive and interactive games more efficiently.
